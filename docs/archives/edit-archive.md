# Editing an Archive

The **Edit Archive** feature in the M&E Monitor allows users with sufficient permissions to update the details of an existing archive. This capability is essential for modifying the archive's title, description, status, or access level as organizational needs evolve.

## Steps to Edit an Archive

To edit an existing archive, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the Archives Listing Page**  
   - From the main menu, go to the **Archives** section to view the list of existing archives.

2. **Select the Edit Option**  
   - Locate the archive you want to edit.  
   - Click the **pen icon** on the archive card to open the **Edit Archive** page. This icon indicates that the archive is available for editing.

3. **Update the Archive Details**  
   - The **Edit Archive** page will appear, displaying a form prefilled with the current details of the archive. You can update the following fields:
     - **Archive Title**: Edit the title of the archive if needed.
     - **Description**: Modify the description to better reflect the purpose or contents of the archive.
     - **Status**: Change the archive's status:
       - **Active**: The archive can be used, and indicators can be moved to it.
       - **Inactive**: The archive is not available for use and cannot receive indicators until reactivated.
     - **Access Level**: Adjust the access level for the archive:
       - **Public**: Accessible to both internal users and external members, appearing in the **Publications** section.
       - **Private**: Available only to the organization of the user who created the archive.
       - **Restricted**: Requires a key for access. The key will control who can view indicators in the archive.

4. **Attach to the Organization**  
   - Archives remain associated with the organization that created them. Any updates will maintain this association, ensuring consistency in data organization.

5. **Save Changes**  
   - After making the necessary updates, click the **"Save"** button to apply the changes. The archive's details will be updated accordingly in the list of archives.

## Additional Information

- When editing, the form fields are prefilled with the current details of the archive, allowing for easy updates without needing to re-enter all the information.
- The archive's access level and status settings can significantly affect who can view and use the archive, so it's important to choose these settings carefully.

## Summary

The **Edit Archive** functionality allows for flexibility in managing archives, enabling users to update archive details as needed. Whether it's changing the title, updating the status, or adjusting the access level, users can keep their archives organized and aligned with current requirements.
