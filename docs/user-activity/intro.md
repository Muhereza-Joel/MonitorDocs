# Overview

On the User Activity Page, administrators can access a detailed record of various activities, including:

- **Comprehensive Action Log:**  
  The page displays a complete log of all actions taken within the system, including Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations. This feature ensures that administrators can track changes made to indicators, archives, and user accounts, providing transparency in system operations.

- **Login Records:**  
  Administrators can view logs of all user login activities. This includes timestamps of when users accessed the system, enhancing security by allowing administrators to monitor access patterns.

- **User Identification:**  
  Each action recorded on the User Activity Page includes information about the user who performed it. This feature helps in identifying responsible parties during an investigation or audit.

- **Timestamp and IP Address Tracking:**  
  The activity log captures the date and time of each action, along with the IP address from which the action was performed. This information is critical for tracing any unauthorized or suspicious activities and helps in ensuring the security and integrity of the system.

## Importance

The User Activity Page serves as the backbone of the auditing process in the M&E Monitor. By providing detailed insights into user actions, it empowers administrators to maintain control over the system and respond promptly to any potential issues. In case of discrepancies or security concerns, this page becomes an invaluable resource for conducting thorough investigations, ensuring that the monitoring and evaluation processes remain robust and reliable.

In summary, the User Activity Page is not only a vital administrative tool but also a key component in maintaining the security and integrity of the M&E Monitor. By closely monitoring user activities, administrators can foster a secure and accountable environment for all system users.
