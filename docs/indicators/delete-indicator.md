# Deleting an Indicator

In the M & E Monitor, the deletion of an Indicator is handled with care to prevent accidental data loss. The following guidelines outline the deletion process and the implications involved:

## Soft Deletion

- **Soft Delete Functionality**: When an Indicator is deleted, it is not permanently removed from the database. Instead, it undergoes a **soft delete**, meaning it is moved to the Trash section. This allows for easy restoration in case of accidental deletion.
- **Restoration from Trash**: Users can restore deleted Indicators from the Trash if needed, provided they have the necessary permissions.

## User Permissions

- **Deletion and Restoration**: Only users with permissions that explicitly allow them to perform delete and restore operations can manage deleted Indicators. This ensures that only authorized personnel can affect the data integrity of the system.
- **Permanent Deletion**: Permanent deletion of an Indicator can only be carried out by the full system administrator. This action removes the Indicator completely from the system, including all associated responses and files. It is important to be cautious with this action, as it cannot be undone.

## Important Considerations

- **Associated Data Loss**: Be aware that when an Indicator is permanently deleted, all responses and files linked to that Indicator will also be deleted from the system. This data loss is irreversible, and caution is advised before proceeding with a permanent delete.
- **Recommended Practices**: Before permanently deleting an Indicator, it is advisable to create a backup or ensure that the associated data is no longer needed. Always confirm the implications of your actions, especially when dealing with critical data.

By following these guidelines and understanding the implications of deletion, users can effectively manage Indicators while minimizing the risk of data loss within the M & E Monitor system.
