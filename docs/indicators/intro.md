# An Overview about Indicators

Indicators are essential tools in the M&E Monitor that help track and measure the progress of projects. They provide quantifiable data for evaluating performance against set targets and baselines. This section guides you through creating, managing, and analyzing indicators to effectively monitor the outcomes and impact of your projects.

Indicators can be configured to track different types of data, including quantitative and qualitative progress. The system allows for flexible customization, enabling users to set baselines, targets, and measure progress over time. Using indicators, you can gain insights into whether your projects are on track, at risk, or off track, and make data-driven decisions to enhance project outcomes.
