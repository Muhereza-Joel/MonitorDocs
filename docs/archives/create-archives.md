# Create An Archive

In the M&E Monitor, users with sufficient permissions can create archives to manage indicators that are no longer actively monitored. Archives help keep the system organized and allow for easy retrieval of historical data. The **Create Archive** feature enables users to add new archives to the system.

## Steps to Create an Archive

To create an archive, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the Archives Listing Page**  
   - From the main menu, go to the **Archives** section to view the list of existing archives.
   - Click the **"Create Archive"** button located at the top right corner of the page.

2. **Fill in the Archive Details**  
   - The **Create Archive** page will appear, prompting the user to provide the following details:
   
   - **Archive Title**: Enter a descriptive title for the archive.
   - **Description**: Provide a brief description of the archive's purpose or contents.
   - **Status**: Choose the archive's status:
     - **Active**: The archive is available for use and can have indicators moved to it.
     - **Inactive**: The archive is not available for use and cannot have indicators moved to it until reactivated.
   - **Access Level**: Specify the access level for the archive:
     - **Public**: The archive is visible to both internal users and external members from other organizations. It will be listed in the **Publications** section under the organization.
     - **Private**: The archive is accessible only to members of the organization that created it. It will not be visible to users from other organizations.
     - **Restricted**: Access to the archive requires a generated key. The key must be entered to view indicators in the archive. The key will be attached to the archive, providing secure access for authorized users only.

3. **Attach the Archive to the Organization**  
   - Archives, like **Theories of Change**, **Indicators**, and **Responses**, are associated with the organization of the user who creates them. This ensures that archives are correctly linked to the user's organization.

4. **Save the Archive**  
   - After filling out the required fields, click the **"Save"** button to create the archive. The new archive will now appear in the list of available archives.

## Access Level Details

- **Private Archives**: Only accessible to the organization of the user who created the archive. These archives are used for internal purposes.
- **Public Archives**: Visible in the **Publications** section, making them accessible to both the organization's members and external users.
- **Restricted Archives**: Require a key to access. The key is used to control access, ensuring that only authorized individuals can view the indicators contained within.

## Summary

The **Create Archive** feature helps users organize and manage indicators by providing a structured approach to archiving. By setting appropriate access levels and statuses, users can control the availability and visibility of archived indicators, ensuring that the system remains efficient and user-friendly.
