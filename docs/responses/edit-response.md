# Editing A Response

In the M&E Monitor, users can edit existing responses to update the recorded details or make corrections. The **Edit Response** page allows users to modify the information previously provided for a response, ensuring that data remains accurate and up-to-date.

## Steps to Edit a Response

   - Click the **"Edit Response"** link associated with the specific response. This will open the **Edit Response** page.


3. **Edit Response Page**  
   - The **Edit Response** page will appear, pre-filled with the existing details of the selected response.


## Edit Response Page Layout

- **Indicator Title**  
  - The title of the indicator will be shown at the top, indicating which indicator the response is being edited for.

- **Previous Current State**  
  - Displays the previously recorded **Current State** for the response. This field is pre-filled but can be updated.

- **Baseline and Target Values**  
  - The **Baseline** and **Target** values for the indicator are displayed as **read-only** fields. These provide context but cannot be edited.

- **Current State**  
  - The **Current State** field will be pre-filled with the previously recorded value but can be updated to reflect new progress.
  - **Note**: This field remains **mandatory** and must be filled in.

- **Progress Bar**  
  - The **progress bar** will show the progress from the baseline based on the current state value. It dynamically updates as the user modifies the **Current State** field.

### Additional Fields for Response Details

- **Notes** (Optional)  
  - The **Notes** field will be pre-filled with the existing notes for the response. The user can update or add new information as needed.

- **Lessons** (Mandatory)  
  - The **Lessons** field will be pre-filled with the existing lessons learned. Updating this field is required to ensure the response remains informative.

- **Recommendations** (Optional)  
  - The **Recommendations** field will be pre-filled with the existing recommendations. Users can update or add new suggestions based on the latest insights.

## Automatic Draft Saving of Response Data

The M&E Monitor features **Automatic Draft Saving** to enhance the user experience and prevent data loss. As the user makes changes to the response, the data is automatically saved in the browser as a draft. This ensures that if the user navigates away from the page and then returns, the previously entered data will be **auto-populated**, allowing them to continue editing without losing progress.

### How It Works

- **Automatic Saving**: As the user fills in or updates fields, the data is periodically saved in the browser's local storage.
- **Auto-Population**: When the user navigates back to the **Edit Response** page, the saved draft data is automatically loaded into the form fields.
- **Draft Clearing**: Upon successful submission of the edited response, the saved draft is cleared from the local storage.  

## Mandatory Fields

- **Current State** and **Lessons** are still required fields when editing a response. They must be updated or confirmed before submitting the changes.
- **Notes** and **Recommendations** remain optional.

## Submitting the Edited Response

After making the necessary updates, Click the <a href="" class="primary-button">Update Response Button</a> button to save the changes. The edited response will be updated, and the indicator's progress will reflect the new information.

## Summary

Editing a response allows users to keep the data for an indicator accurate and relevant. By updating the current state, notes, lessons, and recommendations, users can ensure that the progress tracking for indicators remains comprehensive and up-to-date.
