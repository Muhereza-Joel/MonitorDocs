# Introduction

In the M&E Monitor, archiving indicators is an essential feature for managing the lifecycle of monitoring and evaluation data. It allows users to organize and store indicators that are no longer actively monitored, ensuring that the system remains clean and focused on current activities while preserving historical data for future reference.

## Overview of Archiving Indicators

Archiving involves moving indicators to a designated archive when they are no longer actively tracked or have reached the end of their monitoring cycle. This process keeps the active indicators list manageable, allowing users to focus on ongoing projects without the clutter of outdated or completed indicators. When an indicator's status is set to `Archived`, it can then be moved to a specific archive for better organization.

### Importance of Archiving

1. **Data Organization**  
   Archiving helps maintain a well-organized system by separating active indicators from those that are no longer in use. This makes it easier to manage ongoing projects and reduces clutter.

2. **Preserving Historical Data**  
   Archived indicators retain all their associated data, such as responses and supporting files. This ensures that historical information is preserved for future reference, analysis, and reporting.

3. **Improved System Performance**  
   By moving inactive indicators to an archive, the system becomes more efficient, as it reduces the amount of data that needs to be processed during daily use.

4. **Compliance and Reporting**  
   Some projects may require historical data retention for compliance purposes or to fulfill reporting requirements. Archiving ensures that this data is still accessible without interfering with current operations.

## Summary

Archiving indicators is a crucial part of data management in the M&E Monitor, allowing for better organization, historical data preservation, and system efficiency. It ensures that the monitoring and evaluation process remains focused and effective while still meeting long-term data retention needs.
