# Archiving Indicators

Archiving indicators is an essential feature in the M&E Monitor, allowing users to move completed or inactive indicators to a separate section for better management and organization. This process helps keep the active list of indicators concise and relevant while preserving historical data for future reference.

## Importance of Archiving Indicators

Archiving Indicators is crucial in monitoring and evaluation because it:

- **Organizes the System**: Moves inactive or completed indicators out of the active list, keeping the dashboard uncluttered.
- **Preserves Historical Data**: Ensures past indicators are stored safely and can be accessed if needed for reporting or audit purposes.
- **Supports Data Integrity**: Prevents accidental deletion or modification of indicators that are no longer in active use.

Only indicators with a status of **Archived** can be moved to an archive.

## Indicator Archiving Process

Follow these steps to archive an indicator:

### Ensure the Indicator's Status is Set to "Archived"

Before archiving an indicator, make sure that its status is set to **Archived**. If the indicator is still in the **Draft**, **Review**, or **Public** status, it cannot be moved to an archive.

To change the status:
- Go to the **Edit Indicator** page.
- Edit the indicator and set the **Status** to **Archived**.
- Save the changes by clicking <a href="" class="primary-button">Update Indicator</a> button.

### Choosing an Archive

After setting the status to **Archived**, go back to indicator details and proceed with the archiving process:
- Navigate to the **Indicators Details** list.
- Click the <a href="" class="primary-button">Move Indicator To Archive</a> button

A dialog will appear, prompting you to select an archive. The dialog will list available archives where the indicator can be moved.

### Select an Archive

Choose an appropriate archive from the list:
- If no suitable archive exists, create one under the **Archives** section first.
- Archives can be created with a **Title**, **Description**, and other relevant details to help categorize and organize archived indicators.

Having archives pre-created allows for a smoother and quicker archiving process.
